- software vs program
  - program is simple and usually a single source code file
  - software is a complex piece where more than one program are combined
- characteristics/features of a software
  - functionality - does it do what it was made for
  - reliability - how many times it break
  - usability - how much easier it is to use, learning curve
  - efficiency - how much resources it use
  - maintainability - how much it is easier to add feature of a fix
  - portability - can it run on multiple platforms
- software crisis
  - why it occurred?
    - increasing demand
    - increasing complexity
    - increasing challenges
    - same workforce
    - same methods
    - same tools
  - consequences?
    - project running over budget
    - project running over time
    - software very inefficient
    - projects were unmanageable and code difficult to maintain
    - software of low quality
    - the software often did not meet requirements

## code and fix

### pros

- convenient for small projects
- time saver for low budget projects
- common in software groups where there are many entry level developers
- developers enjoy this model because of full control

### cons

- hard to maintain and change product
- quality related issues
- only for small projects
- hard to estimate end timeline

## waterfall

<img src='./img/waterfall.png' alt='waterfall' width="350px">

### pros

- simple easy to understand 
- phases processes one at a time
- suited for small project with well defined requirements
- all phases are well documented, if someone leave new employee will easily take their place
- enable project managers to track progress
- reduces development and maintenance cost

### cons

- rigid model. results of one phase has to be frozen before starting another phase
  in real life phases can overlap to reduce cost and increase efficiency
- not good for complex and long ongoing projects
- requirements change midway are difficult to accommodate
- no working model till end
- integration done at end, so hard to catch some issues
- heavily document to the point of being bureaucratic
