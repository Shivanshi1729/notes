# Computer Network

1. TOC
{:toc}

# networking

- network - two or mote computers connected together
- networking - two or more computers share data in network

# some terms

## nic

- nic - network interface card
- on pc they are connected through pic
- every nic have a mac address
- my laptop have two mac address
  - one for the ethernet nic card
  - one for the wifi nic card
- dongels which are used to connect to internet through usb
  - they also have nic card embedded and also have mordem
- when we use internet through usb mobile it also have a nic
  - embedded to it so the mac address of the mobile will be used

## topology it defines how the network is connected

- bus topology
- star topology - this is most common now
- ring topology
- mesh topology

## hub (not used anymore)

- earlier when we used to connect multiple computers together
  we need more nic card, because one nic card can be used to 
  connect to another computer, but if a second computer comes in
  you have to purchase another nic card for it.
  so if network become large you cannot purchase that many cards
- hub broadcast the data
- hub shared bandwidth, i.e. if 8mbps internet speed is given to it
  it will distribute to all the devices, so suppose 4 devices are connected
	each will get 2mbps even when someone is not using it
- hub usually have 4 to 8 ports
- less no of ports

## switch

- more port - 24
- learns mac address and don't broadcast the data

**Note**
- Unicast - one to one, 
- Multicast - one to many,
- Broadcast - one to all

## bridge

- software based
- less ports compared to switch

## router

- does routing

## repeater

- amplify the signal
- after 100m ethernet used

## modem

- modulation - analog to digital
- demodulation - digital to analog

# osi model

- developed by iso
- dod - department of defense model, later renamed to `tcp/ip`
  - most used now
- osi - reference model, only rules and regulations
  - tcp/ip model - follow this
  - there are other models too,
- other network protocols are
  - netware - used by windows earlier, for file sharing
  - appletalk

## layers

**APSTNDP**

- application 
- presentation
- session
- transport
- network
- data link
- physical

**NOTE:**
- every layer have some PDU - protocol data unit
  which is the type of data present in that layer

## application

- software generate the data
- pdu - data

## presentation

- format of the data
- compression and decompression
- encrypt and decrypt data
- pdu - data

## session

- maintain the session via port numbers
- like same website on different tabs on browser
- or different application
- data will not get intermixed
- pdu - data

## transport

- end to end delivery of the data
- udp and tcp protocols are used
- flow control - don't send more data
- congestion control - too many packets in the network
- segmentation - dividing into packets
- error correction
- pdu - segment

## network

- ip address
- source and destination address headers are added
- routing is done
- ip, ipx protocol are used
- pdu - packets

## data link 

- source and destination mac address is added
- `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` broadcast mac address, or add mac address of the gateway
- they keep on changing when frame is passed between routers
- ip address in never changed
- pdu - frames

## physical

- connecters, cables, hub, work on this layer
- pdu - bit

# tcp/ip model

- application
  - OSI - application, presentation, session mix
- transport
  - OSI - transport 
- internet
  - OSI - network
- network access
  - OSI - data link, physical

## ports

- both udp and tcp have - (1-65535) number of ports, $2^{16} - 1 = 65535$
- because port no is a 18 bit number (2 byte)

<br>

- well known ports - 1 to 23
- registered ports - 1024 - 49151, assigned by IANA, internet assigned number authority
- dynamic ports, generated by pc, bound by the port you create on pc, rest of remaining ports
- use `netstat` on windows

### some common ports

#### tcp

- ftp - 21, file transfer protocol
- ssh - 22
- telnet - 23
- smtp - 25
- http - 80
- https - 443
- pop - 110
- dns - 53

#### udp

- tftp - 69, trivial ftp
- dhcp - 67/68
- smtp
- dns - 53

# software in networking

- cisco packet tracer
- gcna
- ping - packet internet gopher, works on icmp protocol


## packet tracer

### router

- connect router to a end device through a cable
  - 

Modes:
- usermode
- privilege mode `enable` `disable`
- configuration mode `configure terminal`

- `?` for help whenever you want
- `Ctrl+shift+6` to stop execution of a command
- `show version`
- `show ip` - show routing table
- `show history` - history
- `show clock`

### connect two pc

- cross over cable is used


# ip

## types

|class | ip              |subnet          |         use          |
|------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|
|A     | `1-127.x.x.x`   | `255.0.0.0`    | huge corporations    |
|B     | `128-191.x.x.x` | `255.255.0.0`  | big companies        |
|C     | `192-223.x.x.x` | `255.255.255.0`| small companies      |
|D     | `224-239.x.x.x` |                | multicast            |
|E     | `240-255.x.x.x` |                | research/development |

but some are reserved for private use in each class

- class A - `10.0.0.0` - `10.255.255.255`
- class B - `172.16.0.0` - `172.16.0.0`
- class C - `192.168.0.0` - `192.168.255.255`

**Note**
- `127` - `0111` `1111` - `    + 64 + 32 + 16 + 15`
- `191` - `1011` `1111` - `128 +    + 32 + 16 + 15`
- `223` - `1101` `1111` - `128 + 64 +    + 16 + 15`
- `239` - `1110` `1111` - `128 + 64 + 32 +    + 15`
- `255` - `1111` `1111` - `128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 15`

how to remember

- `127` + 64 - 191
- `191` + 32 - 223
- `223` + 16 - `255`

so we can recognize the class of ip using first four bit

| Starting Bit | Class |
|--------------|-------|
| `0`          |   A   |
| `10`         |   B   |
| `110`        |   C   |
| `1110`       |   D   |
| `1111`       |   E   |

## subnetting

- dividing network in smaller networks
