## Outcomes - vid1,2,3

- understand sdlc - software development life cycle
- creation of software requirements specification
  - functional - operation that the software wil do
  - non functional - speed, reliability
- comparing various methodologies of the software development
  and there applicability in developing specific type
  of software product.
- construct an efficient design specific document to obtain
  the design product pre user requirements
- be able to develop software applications using the concept
  applicable to various sdlc
- study various testing techniques and identify their 
  relevance in developing quality software
- requirement of software maintenance as a major activity
  in sdlc
- examine various tools used in all phases of software 
  construction
- understand concepts of software project management and
  quality assurance

## what is se

- software is 
  - pervasive
  - complex
- software comprises of
  - instructions that when executes provide
    desired features, function and performance
  - data structures that enable the program to 
    adequately store and manipulate information
  - documentation - that describe the operation
    and use of the program - user manual and
    developer manual
  - custom/bespoke - for someone for specific function
  - off the shelf/generic - for vast population - os

## engineering

- study of scientific principles to design and 
  build machine, structures, and other things
- **scientific principles**

## se

- **ieee** - a systematic, disciplined, 
  quantifiable approach to the development, 
  operation, and maintenance of software;
  that is the application of engineering of software

### objectives

- quality, and schedule and budget
- disciplined and systematic
- on time, within budget, and satisfies the requirements
- relies on past experiences, technical methodologies,
  guidelines

## wheel
